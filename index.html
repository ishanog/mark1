      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <h1>The First Terminal Examination-2078 </h1>
    <h3> Grade: Ten</h3>	<h3>Subject: English</h3> 	<h3>Full marks: 40</h3>	<h3>Pass Marks: 15</h3>
  <h1>1. Read the following poem and answer the questions that follow: </h1>
  <h3> When my mother died I was very young, </h3>
  <h3>  And my father sold me while yet my tongue</h3>
  <h3>      Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"</h3>
  <h3>  So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.</h3>
  <h3>  There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head</h3>
  <h3>  That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,</h3>
  <h3>  "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,</h3>
  <h3>  You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."</h3>
  <h3>  And so he was quiet, & that very night,</h3>
  <h3>  As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!</h3>
  <h3>  That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack,</h3>
  <h3>  Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;</h3>
  <h3>  And by came an Angel who had a bright key,</h3>
  <h3>  And he opened the coffins & set them all free;</h3>
  <h3>  Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,</h3>
  <h3>  And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.</h3>
  <h3>  Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,</h3>
  <h3>  They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.</h3>
  <h3>  And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,</h3>
  <h3>  He'd have God for his father & never want joy.</h3>
  <h3>  And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark</h3>
  <h3>  And got with our bags & our brushes to work.</h3>
  <h3>     Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm;</h3>
  <h3>  So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.</h3>

            <h3> The development of the Space Shuttle has dramatically reduced the cost of sending loads into space. The Shuttle takes off from earth like a rocket, and lands again like an aircraft. It can transport not only its own crew, but also passengers, and has a huge cargo-hold which is capable of carrying large satellites or a space laboratory. Before the Space Shuttle was created, it was necessary to plan trips into space several years in advance. However, for the rest of the century it should be possible to make space flights every week or so. Any scientist or engineer needing to travel into orbit will simply take the next Shuttle flight, stay as long as necessary, and then return at his or her convenience. </h3>
